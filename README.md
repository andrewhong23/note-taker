# note-taker

## Description

Here I have created a nice note taking app where one can enter in a title and not and it will save them in one place.   


## Installation

This was made mostly with Express.Js.  There needed to be routes created from the two HTML flies.  Also, routes needed to be created for each API that was created from the different pages.  Using express made saving notes and using post and get possible.   

## Usage

A user will type in a title and a note in the space provided.  When you click on the save button, the note will save in the notes colomn.
